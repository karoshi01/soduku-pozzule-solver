# soduku-pozzule-solver
This is a C program that solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes the puzzle input from the user (with 0 representing empty cells), applies Sudoku rules to validate placements, and attempts to solve the puzzle recursively. If a solution exists, it prints the completed board in a formatted, readable grid.
Accepts full puzzle input from the user via the console
     Validates input using standard Sudoku rules:
        No repeated numbers in any row
        No repeated numbers in any column
        No repeated numbers in any 3Ã—3 subgrid
    Uses recursion and backtracking to explore all valid configurations
    Prints the original and solved puzzle in a clean, readable format
    Demonstrates how constraint satisfaction problems can be solved with recursion

How It Works
    User Input:
    The user is prompted to enter the values for each cell in the 9x9 grid. 0 is used to represent empty cells.
    Validation (checkRules function):
    Before placing any number in an empty cell, the program checks:
        Is the number already in the current row?
        Is the number already in the current column?
        Is the number already in the current 3x3 box?
    Backtracking (solveSudoku function):
        The program attempts to place numbers 1 to 9 in each empty cell.
        If a number is valid, it is placed temporarily.
        The solver then moves to the next empty cell recursively.
        If a dead end is reached, it backtracks and tries a new number.
        This continues until the board is fully filled or deemed unsolvable.
    Output:
    If a solution is found, the program prints the solved puzzle with borders and formatting. Otherwise, it notifies that no solution exists.
